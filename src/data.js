      "I have created COVID-19 Tracker/Stats Application. I have used React with the addition of Charts.js, Material UI, and many different modules. I have fetched the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax. This application helped me to improve my skills for React JS and now I have a strong understanding of React's workflow, including data fetching, hooks, folder structure, and more.",

      "DocuBuilder is primarily built on Java Core libraries and interfaces. For our project at AIT Global, I created a logging mechanism which increased the efficiency and productivity for my team and reduced the time consumption for debugging by about 60%. Implemented Junit which is widely used testing framework for our ongoing project. It helped us to define the flow of execution of our code and was of great use for the developers for testing purpose. Worked as a front-end developer wherein I have created grid tables, trees, list, forms and more for our web application DocuBuilder with the help of JavaScript libraries dhtmlx and datatables.",
